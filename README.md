I used Python to clean the extracted data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, 1989-2016, and analyse the trends in wealth according to the provided task.

### Task

1. Please summarize key trends in median wealth over the last 30 years by race and education using plots
and in writing.
2. Repeat your analysis for just housing wealth for black and white households.
3. Many households are not homeowners and so your analysis for the prior question includes many zeros
for housing wealth. Letâ€™s dig deeper by focusing just on homeowners age 25 or older. Please summarize
trends in for black and white households for both housing and non-housing wealth. Which group had
the largest loss in housing wealth, where 2007 is defined as the base period? Please answer this question
both in dollar terms and in proportional terms.
4. Many potential channels have been identified for explaining the wealth gaps by race documented in
question 1. These include differences in access to financial markets, segregation, discrimination, family
networks, neighborhood characteristics, and barriers to human capital accumulation. Please pick at
least two hypotheses (they do not need to be included in the list above) and explain what evidence you
might want to assemble to test the importance of these channels.
